The main objective of the project is to create two programs: a client and a server. The server program must be able to receive messages from the client program and display them on the terminal. The communication between the client and server is achieved using Unix signals, which are software interrupts used for inter-process communication.
The project aims to reinforce the understanding of the following concepts:

Unix signal handling
Client-server model
Process management
Bit manipulation
